# EaselyBot Bug Fixes and Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document details all bug fixes and improvements made to the EaselyBot Canvas LMS integration chatbot. These fixes ensure proper task filtering, timezone handling, error recovery, and webhook event processing.

## Date: September 19, 2025

---

## 1. Manila Timezone Support

### Problem
- All date/time operations were using UTC, causing confusion for users in Manila (UTC+8)
- Task filtering was incorrect due to timezone mismatches
- "Due today" showed wrong tasks based on UTC instead of local time

### Solution
Added timezone-aware helper functions in `app/core/event_handler.py`:

```python
def get_manila_now():
    """Get current datetime in Manila timezone"""
    import pytz
    from datetime import datetime, timezone
    manila_tz = pytz.timezone('Asia/Manila')
    return datetime.now(timezone.utc).astimezone(manila_tz)

def convert_to_manila_time(utc_datetime):
    """Convert UTC datetime to Manila timezone"""
    import pytz
    manila_tz = pytz.timezone('Asia/Manila')
    return utc_datetime.astimezone(manila_tz)
```

### Files Modified
- `app/core/event_handler.py` - Added timezone utilities and updated all date operations
- `requirements.txt` - Added `pytz>=2023.3` dependency

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Correct local time display for all assignments
- ‚úÖ Accurate "due today" and "due this week" filtering
- ‚úÖ Proper time difference calculations (e.g., "Due in 2 hours")

---

## 2. Task Filtering Improvements

### Problem
- Completed tasks were showing up in task lists
- Date range filters had incorrect boundaries
- "Due this week" included overdue and today's tasks
- "All tasks" showed past assignments

### Solution
Enhanced `filter_assignments_by_date()` function with:
- Completed task exclusion based on status field
- Corrected date boundaries for each filter type
- Manila timezone awareness for all comparisons

### Filter Logic
- **Today**: Only tasks due between 00:00 and 23:59 today (Manila time)
- **This Week**: Tasks due tomorrow through next 7 days (excludes today)
- **Overdue**: Tasks with due date before today's start
- **All**: All future tasks including today

### Files Modified
- `app/core/event_handler.py` - Updated filter_assignments_by_date()

### Impact
- ‚úÖ No more completed tasks in active lists
- ‚úÖ Correct date range filtering
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between filter categories

---

## 3. Message Limit Removal and Infinite Loop Prevention

### Problem
- Task lists were truncated at 15 items with "... and N more" message
- Users couldn't see all their assignments
- **CRITICAL**: Automatic main menu after task display caused infinite loops
- Main menu was shown after errors, causing users to re-click buttons repeatedly
- Unrecognized text also triggered main menu, perpetuating the loop

### Solution
- Removed the 15-task limit in `send_assignments_individually()`
- Removed the "... and N more" truncation message
- **Completely removed automatic main menu displays in all task handlers**
- Replaced main menu with simple text prompts ("Type 'menu' for options")
- Fixed error handlers to not show menu automatically
- Fixed unrecognized input handler to not show menu
- Fixed unknown payload handler to not show menu

### Key Changes
```python
# BEFORE (causes infinite loop):
send_assignments_individually(sender_id, tasks, header)
messenger_api.send_main_menu(sender_id)  # This caused loops!

# AFTER (prevents loop):
send_assignments_individually(sender_id, tasks, header)
messenger_api.send_text_message(sender_id, 
    "üí° Type 'menu' for more options or 'help' if you need assistance!")
```

### Files Modified
- `app/core/event_handler.py` - Multiple functions updated:
  - `send_assignments_individually()` - Removed automatic menu, added text prompt
  - `handle_get_tasks_today()` - Removed menu from error handling
  - `handle_get_tasks_week()` - Removed menu from error handling
  - `handle_get_tasks_overdue()` - Removed menu from error handling
  - `handle_get_tasks_all()` - Removed menu from error handling
  - `handle_message()` - Removed menu for unrecognized input
  - `handle_postback()` - Removed menu for unknown payloads

### Impact
- ‚úÖ **No more infinite loops when viewing tasks**
- ‚úÖ All assignments are displayed to users
- ‚úÖ Users have control over when to see the menu
- ‚úÖ Better user experience without constant menu popups
- ‚úÖ Users can see complete task lists without interruption

## 4. Webhook Event Handling

### Problem
- Facebook "delivery" and "read" events caused errors
- Invalid `processing_status` values violated database constraints
- Unhandled event types logged with "warning" status (invalid)

### Solution
Added proper handling for all Facebook webhook event types:
- `delivery` events - Acknowledged but not processed
- `read` events - Acknowledged but not processed  
- Unknown events - Logged with "success" status instead of "warning"

### Files Modified
- `main.py` - Updated process_message_event() function

### Database Constraint Fix
Changed all processing_status values to valid options:
- ‚úÖ "success"
- ‚úÖ "error"
- ‚ùå ~~"warning"~~ (removed invalid status)

### Impact
- ‚úÖ No more database constraint violations
- ‚úÖ Proper handling of all Facebook event types
- ‚úÖ Cleaner logs without unnecessary warnings

---

## 5. Error Recovery and Retry Logic

### Problem
- No retry mechanism for failed API calls
- Canvas API rate limits caused failures
- Network timeouts resulted in lost requests
- Database connection issues weren't handled

### Solution
Created comprehensive retry utility module (`app/utils/retry_helper.py`) with:

#### Retry Strategies
1. **Simple Retry** - Fixed delay between attempts
2. **Exponential Backoff** - Increasing delays with jitter
3. **Circuit Breaker** - Prevents cascading failures

#### Features
- Configurable retry attempts and delays
- Automatic detection of retryable errors
- HTTP status code analysis (429, 500, 502, 503, 504)
- Database error pattern matching
- Logging of retry attempts

### Files Added
- `app/utils/retry_helper.py` - Complete retry utility module

### Files Modified
- `app/api/canvas_api.py` - Added @exponential_backoff_retry decorator

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Automatic recovery from temporary failures
- ‚úÖ Better handling of rate limits
- ‚úÖ Improved reliability for API calls
- ‚úÖ Prevents service overload with circuit breaker

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### Problem
- Large assignment lists could cause performance issues
- No performance testing for scale

### Solution
- Optimized date filtering algorithms
- Added performance benchmarks
- Tested with 100+ assignments

### Performance Results
- Today filter: < 1ms for 100 assignments
- Week filter: < 1ms for 100 assignments
- All filters perform in < 100ms even with large datasets

### Files Added
- `test_canvas_integration.py` - Performance test suite

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Excellent performance with large datasets
- ‚úÖ Sub-second response times
- ‚úÖ Scalable to hundreds of assignments

---

## 7. Testing Infrastructure

### Problem
- No comprehensive test coverage
- Manual testing was time-consuming
- No validation of fixes

### Solution
Created comprehensive test suites:

#### Test Files Created
1. `test_all_fixes.py` - Tests all bug fixes
   - Timezone functions
   - Date filtering
   - Webhook handling
   - Database constraints
   - Message formatting

2. `test_canvas_integration.py` - End-to-end Canvas tests
