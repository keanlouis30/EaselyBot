# EaselyBot Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-09-20

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. IndentationError in event_handler.py (Line 1467)
**Problem:** The `buttons` variable in the `handle_show_premium` function was incorrectly indented, causing the application to fail on startup.

**Solution:** Fixed indentation on line 1460 to properly align the `buttons` variable inside the function.

**File Modified:** `app/core/event_handler.py`

---

#### 2. "Get All Tasks" Not Showing All Tasks
**Problem:** When clicking "All Tasks", tasks due in the future (e.g., on the 26th) were not appearing because the filter was only showing tasks from today onwards.

**Solution:** Updated the `filter_assignments_by_date` function to show ALL non-completed tasks when using the 'all' filter, regardless of due date.

**File Modified:** `app/core/event_handler.py` (lines 781-784)

**Before:**
```python
elif filter_type == 'all':
    # All future assignments in Manila time (including today and beyond)
    if due_date_manila >= today_start:
        filtered.append(assignment)
```

**After:**
```python
elif filter_type == 'all':
    # All assignments that are NOT completed (show everything: future, today, and even overdue)
    # This should show ALL tasks regardless of due date
    filtered.append(assignment)
```

#### 3. Task Creation Not Using Canvas API
**Problem:** When creating tasks, they were only being saved to the local database and not created in Canvas itself.

**Solution:** 
- Added `create_assignment` method to Canvas API client for creating assignments in courses
- Updated `create_and_sync_task` function to create tasks in Canvas FIRST (as calendar events), then save to database with Canvas IDs
- Tasks are now properly synced with Canvas calendar

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/canvas_api.py` - Added `create_assignment` method (lines 254-329)
- `app/core/event_handler.py` - Updated `create_and_sync_task` function (lines 1347-1451)

---

#### 4. Updated Onboarding Message
**Problem:** The onboarding message needed to include feature lists and upgrade instructions.

**Solution:** Modified the onboarding flow to send three separate messages:
1. Introduction message
2. Features message (with free and premium features listed)
3. Privacy policy prompt

**File Modified:** `app/api/messenger_api.py` (lines 394-433)

**Key Addition:** Added upgrade instruction: "If you choose to upgrade, please message Kean Rosales, or facebook.com/keanlouis30"

---

### Testing
Created test scripts to verify all fixes:
- `test_fixes_simple.py` - Verifies code changes without external dependencies
- All tests pass successfully

### Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Get All Tasks**: Now shows ALL tasks (past, present, and future) when clicked
2. **Task Creation**: Creates tasks in Canvas calendar first, then saves to database with proper Canvas IDs
3. **Onboarding**: Shows feature list with upgrade instructions in a separate message
4. **No More Errors**: IndentationError fixed, application starts successfully

### Deployment Notes
- All Python files compile without errors
- Changes are backward compatible
- No database schema changes required
- Ready for deployment to Render

### Files Changed
1. `app/core/event_handler.py`
2. `app/api/canvas_api.py`
3. `app/api/messenger_api.py`

### Verification
Run `python3 test_fixes_simple.py` to verify all changes are working correctly.
