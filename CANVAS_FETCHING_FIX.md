# Canvas Assignment Fetching Fix

## Date: 2025-09-20

### Problem
Users reported that not all future assignments were showing up when clicking "Upcoming". For example, tasks due on the 26th were missing. The bot was only showing a limited number of assignments.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Limited Date Range:** The `fetch_user_assignments` function was calling `get_upcoming_assignments` which only fetched assignments for the next 90 days.

2. **No Pagination:** Canvas API returns results in pages (typically 10-100 items per page). The bot was only fetching the first page of results from each endpoint.

3. **Incomplete Data:** Without pagination, if a course had more than 100 assignments, or a user had more than 100 courses, many items would be missing.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Added Pagination Support
**File:** `app/api/canvas_api.py`

- Modified `_make_request` method to support pagination
- Follows Canvas API "Link" headers to fetch all pages
- Collects all results across multiple pages

#### 2. Enabled Pagination for Key Methods
- `get_user_courses()` - Now fetches ALL courses (paginate=True)
- `get_assignments()` - Now fetches ALL assignments from each course (paginate=True)

#### 3. Fixed fetch_user_assignments
**Before:**
```python
# Only got assignments for next 90 days
assignments = canvas_client.get_upcoming_assignments(token, days_ahead=90)
```

**After:**
```python
# Gets ALL assignments from all courses
assignments = canvas_client.get_assignments(token, limit=limit)
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix

#### Data Fetching Process
1. When syncing with Canvas, the bot now:
   - Fetches ALL courses (not just first page)
   - For EACH course, fetches ALL assignments (not just first 100)
   - No date range limitations
   - Caches everything in database

#### User Experience
- **"Upcoming" button** - Shows ALL future tasks from today onwards
- **No missing assignments** - Tasks due on any future date will appear
- **Complete data** - Even courses with hundreds of assignments work correctly
- **Force sync available** - Users can click "Sync Canvas" to refresh

### Testing
Run `python3 test_canvas_pagination.py` to verify:
- ✅ Pagination is implemented
- ✅ All methods use pagination
- ✅ No date range limits
- ✅ Complete data fetching

### Important Notes

1. **Initial Sync May Take Longer:** Since we're now fetching ALL data, the first sync after this update may take a few extra seconds.

2. **Database Caching:** Once fetched, assignments are cached in the database for fast access. Subsequent views are instant.

3. **Manual Sync:** Users can force a fresh sync by:
   - Using the burger menu → "Canvas Setup" → "Sync Canvas"
   - Or typing "sync" in the chat

### Files Modified
- `app/api/canvas_api.py` - Added pagination, fixed fetching logic
- Previous files remain unchanged

### Deployment
After deploying these changes:
1. Users should manually sync Canvas once to fetch all assignments
2. All future assignments will then be visible
3. The "Upcoming" filter will show complete data
