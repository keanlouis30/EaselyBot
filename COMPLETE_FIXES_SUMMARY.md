## 2. Task Filtering Fixed

### Previous Issue
When clicking "View All", the bot was showing ALL tasks including overdue ones (tasks from the past), which was confusing.

### Solution Applied
- Changed the 'all' filter to only show upcoming tasks (from today onwards)
- Updated menu button from "View All" to "Upcoming" for clarity
- Updated header from "ðŸ—¾ All Upcoming Tasks" to "ðŸ“… Upcoming Tasks"

### Current Behavior
| Filter Button | What it Shows |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Due Today** | Only tasks due today |
| **This Week** | Tasks from today through Sunday |
| **Overdue** | Only past-due tasks |
| **Upcoming** | All future tasks from today onwards (excludes overdue) |

**Key Point:** Tasks due on the 26th will now appear in "Upcoming" but overdue tasks will NOT.

## 3. Task Creation Flow Fixed

### Previous Issue
Tasks were only saved to the local database, not created in Canvas.

### Solution Applied
- Added `create_assignment` method to Canvas API
- Modified `create_and_sync_task` to create tasks in Canvas FIRST
- Tasks are created as Canvas calendar events (since students can't create assignments)
- Canvas event ID is saved in the database for proper syncing

### Current Behavior
1. User creates a task
2. Task is created in Canvas calendar
3. Task is saved to database with Canvas event ID
4. Both systems stay in sync

## 4. Onboarding Messages Updated

### Changes Made
The onboarding now sends THREE separate messages:

1. **Introduction Message:**
   "Hi! I'm Easely, your personal Canvas assistant..."

2. **Features Message:**
   - Lists Free Features
   - Shows upgrade instruction: "If you choose to upgrade, please message Kean Rosales, or facebook.com/keanlouis30"
   - Lists Premium Features

3. **Privacy Policy Prompt:**
   "ðŸ”’ To get started, please review our Privacy Policy..."
