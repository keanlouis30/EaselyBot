# Task Creation Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete task creation flow for the EaselyBot Canvas assistant. Users can now create tasks/calendar events in Canvas through a conversational interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. User Flow
The task creation follows this conversation flow:
1. User selects "Create a Task" from menu or types "create task"
2. Bot asks for task title
3. User provides title → Bot asks for due date
4. User provides date → Bot asks for due time
5. User provides time → Bot asks for description (optional)
6. User provides description or skips → Bot creates task in Canvas

### 2. Input Handlers Implemented

#### Task Title Handler (`handleTaskTitleInput`)
- Accepts any text as task title
- Stores title in user session
- Transitions to date input state

#### Date Input Handler (`handleCustomDateInput`)
- Supports multiple date formats:
  - Natural language: "tomorrow", "today", "next Monday", "next week"
  - Standard formats: "YYYY-MM-DD", "MM-DD-YYYY"
  - Month/day formats: "Dec 25", "December 25"
- Validates input and provides helpful error messages
- Stores date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Transitions to time input state

#### Time Input Handler (`handleCustomTimeInput`)
- Supports multiple time formats:
  - 12-hour: "3pm", "11:59 PM", "2:30 AM"
  - 24-hour: "15:00", "23:59"
  - Special: "noon" (converts to 12:00 PM)
- Validates input and provides error messages
- Stores time in HH:mm format
- Transitions to description input state

#### Description Handler (`handleTaskDetailsInput`)
- Accepts any text as description
- User can type "skip" to create task without description
- Calls Canvas API to create the task
- Shows success message with task details
- Returns user to main menu

### 3. State Management
The implementation uses conversation states to track the user's progress:
- `creating_task_title` - Waiting for task title
- `creating_task_date` - Waiting for due date
- `creating_task_time` - Waiting for due time  
- `creating_task_description` - Waiting for description

Session data stored:
- `task_title` - The task title entered
- `task_date` - Due date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `task_time` - Due time in HH:mm format

### 4. Timezone Support
All date/time operations use **Asia/Manila timezone** consistently:
- Date parsing uses Manila timezone
- Time parsing uses Manila timezone
- Task creation sends Manila timezone to Canvas API

### 5. Canvas API Integration
The `createCanvasTask` function in `canvasApi.js`:
- Fetches user's Canvas token from database
- Creates a calendar event using Canvas API
- Returns created task details
- Handles errors gracefully

## Code Files Modified

1. **`app/core/eventHandler.js`**
   - Added all task input handlers
   - Updated state checking functions
   - Integrated with Canvas API

2. **`app/api/canvasApi.js`** (previously implemented)
   - `createCanvasTask` function for Canvas calendar event creation
   - Assignment fetching by categories (today, week, month, overdue)

3. **`test-task-flow.js`** (new test file)
   - Validates date/time parsing logic
   - Shows example conversation flow

## Testing Results
✅ Application starts successfully
✅ Date parsing works for various formats
✅ Time parsing handles multiple formats
✅ Weekday calculations work correctly (e.g., "next Monday")
✅ Manila timezone properly configured

## Example Usage
```
User: "Create a task"
Bot: "📝 What's the task title?"
User: "Complete Physics Assignment"
Bot: "📅 When is it due? Please enter a date"
User: "tomorrow"
Bot: "📅 Date set: September 24, 2025
     ⏰ What time is it due?"
User: "11:59 PM"
Bot: "⏰ Time set: 11:59 PM
     📝 Would you like to add a description?"
User: "Chapter 5 problems 1-20"
Bot: "✅ Task created successfully in Canvas!
     📝 Title: Complete Physics Assignment
     📅 Due: September 24, 2025 at 11:59 PM Manila
     📔 Description: Chapter 5 problems 1-20"
```

## Next Steps (if needed)
- Add course selection for task association
- Add task editing capabilities
- Add task deletion features
