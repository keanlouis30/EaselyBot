# IndentationError Fix - Final Resolution

## Date: 2025-09-20

### Problem
The application was failing to start on Render with an IndentationError:
```
File "/opt/render/project/src/app/core/event_handler.py", line 1467
    messenger_api.send_button_template(sender_id, premium_text, buttons)
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

### Root Cause
There were TWO indentation issues in `app/core/event_handler.py`:

1. **Line 700**: In the `handle_token_input` function, a `messenger_api.send_text_message` call was incorrectly indented with extra spaces.
2. **Line 1460** (previously fixed): The `buttons` variable in `handle_show_premium` was incorrectly indented.

### Solution Applied

#### Fix #1: Line 700 (handle_token_input function)
**Before:**
```python
    # Show success message and offer premium upgrade
        messenger_api.send_text_message(  # <-- Extra indentation here!
            sender_id,
            "Great! Your Canvas integration is complete.\n\n"
            ...
        )
```

**After:**
```python
    # Show success message and offer premium upgrade
    messenger_api.send_text_message(  # <-- Fixed indentation
        sender_id,
        "Great! Your Canvas integration is complete.\n\n"
        ...
    )
```

#### Fix #2: Line 1460 (handle_show_premium function) - Already Fixed
**Before:**
```python
    )
    
buttons = [  # <-- Not indented properly
```

**After:**
```python
    )
    
    buttons = [  # <-- Properly indented
```

### Verification
- Created `check_indentation.py` script to verify all files
- All three main files now pass indentation checks:
  - ✅ app/core/event_handler.py
  - ✅ app/api/messenger_api.py
  - ✅ app/api/canvas_api.py

### Deployment Instructions
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Render should automatically redeploy
3. The application should start without IndentationError

### Files Modified
- `app/core/event_handler.py` (line 700 fixed)

### Testing
Run `python3 check_indentation.py` to verify all Python files are free of indentation errors.
