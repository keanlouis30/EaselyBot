## 📝 Notes for Admin Dashboard Integration

To integrate with your admin dashboard, use the `/broadcast` endpoint:

```javascript
// Example from admin dashboard
fetch('https://your-bot-url.com/broadcast', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    // Add authentication headers as needed
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Update Notice',
    message: 'New features are now available!',
    recipients: userIds // Array of Facebook user IDs
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(`Sent to ${data.successful} users`);
  console.log(`Failed for ${data.failed} users`);
});
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

Before deployment, ensure you have:
1. Facebook Page Access Token
2. Webhook Verify Token
3. Supabase credentials (optional but recommended)
4. Canvas API configuration (for full functionality)

All features work as specified and the bot is ready for production deployment!
